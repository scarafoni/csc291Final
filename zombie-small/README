Zombie Gridworld
by Dan Scarafoni, Brian Leu, Jon Wong
CSC291 final project

changes from original gridworld
-------------------------------
    -gridworld-world.lisp contains all the changes for the agent and the world
    -simulation-and-function-evaluation.lisp contains changes for environmental factors to handle moving zombie events
    -go.lisp has the environmental effects unaltered
    -writeup.pdf is the report for the project

compiling instructions
----------------------
    -the code works the same as normal gridworld.
    -run the program by entering lisp and then loading init.lisp.
    -all commands from this point are identical to normal gridworld (e.g. (go!), (listen!), etc...)

World description (brief)
-------------------------
    -the world is a grid used to simulate an abandoned house
    -food (chickens) are scattered throughout
    -AG, an apocalypse survivor, must navigate the house
        -his central goal is to leave the building, which involves finding a crowbard to open
         a barricaded door
    -AG must avoid the wanding zombie, which will kill him if contact is made
    -AG can pick up chickens to eat to sate his hunger, but will only do so when it is worth the effort
